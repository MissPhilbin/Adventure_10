# Adventures In Raspberry Pi by Carrie Anne Philbin
## Adventure 10 resources

This repository contains code required for the Adventure 10 project in
"Adventures in Raspberry Pi". Included code is:

* vlc.py: Python bindings to libvlc, taken from <http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/bindings/python.git;a=tree;f=generated;b=HEAD>
* Adafruit_CharLCD.py: a modified version of Adafruit's library for interfacing
  with 16x2 LCDs on the Pi. Taken from
  <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code>. The default
  GPIO pins were modified, and the file was reindented to deal with Python 3's
  more strict rules on mixed indents.
